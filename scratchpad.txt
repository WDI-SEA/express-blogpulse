Part 1: Create a Comment model
In order to add comments, create a Sequelize model to store comments. It's recommended that you name this model comment. It will store three attributes: the name of the person creating the comment (as a string), the content of the comment (as text), and the article that the comment belongs to (as an integer)

Once this model has been created, add the associations between comments the articles. This may look similar to how Authors and Articles are related in the existing code in this app. Note the associate section in the models for both article and author.

sequelize model:create --name comment --attributes name:string,content:text,articleId:integer
